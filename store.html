  <h1>Joe's Clothes</h1>
  <h3>Our mission statement:</h3>
  <p>Joe's Clothes is a mom and pop shop run by two boys who are neither mothers nor fathers. But what we lack in parental authority we make up for in our passion for design. Designing shirts, designing webpages; truly, what is the difference? Anyway, please enjoy this limited run of shirts designed by a boy with no prior experience.</p>
  <h2>Creature Company</h2>

  <p>In the middle of the animal city is the creature company! These animals are hard at work doing who knows what. Whatever they're doing seems to be working, because those numbers are going up!</p>
  <h2>The Guy</h2>

  <p>One day, a city erects a bus stuff. The next day, a gaping hole appears where the bus stop once was. For you see, this guy <em>is</em> the bus stop. With the strength of one whole guy, he punches the bus and it miraculously stops in its tracks. Oh wait, it looks like the bus driver just hit the brakes.</p>
  <h3>Customer reviews:</h3>
  <p>"I'm warm," says an impassioned reviewer (who may or may not be the designer of the shirts) of the esteemed winter collection. This collection is held in such high esteem that it isn't shown or even listed on this web page.</p>
